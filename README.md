EAMUS!
The game Me and my team were developing for "Product Development" course in University
This is by all means not the best game made, but to be honest we were first year students back then.

This was meant to be full simulator, where the main feature was a startup procedure. it all had specialized buttons for all of the actions.
Please look at the presentation, to reffer to Start and go procedure. I was not able to find the original start up document.

This project in highsight was meant to be a connection between Software and Hardware, we were planning to make physical controller to map all of the buttons in the game.
We made a first prototype, however no matter how hard we tried we could not make arduino work, simply because we had to have roughly 30 input toggles, and in order to make it 
work, we needed to daisy chain input controllers, but they were not returning correct data, so that idea was scrapped.

We had 2 month to develop this from start to finish, so development was rushed.

Here is a trailer for this project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIzg9ofQmsg

Here are some screenshots from the game
